            <h3>What is a Gundam?</h3>
            <p>
                Gundam (Japanese: ガンダムシリーズ) is a Japanese military science fiction media franchise. Created by Yoshiyuki
                Tomino and Sunrise, the franchise features giant robots, or mecha, with the
                name "Gundam". The franchise began on April 7, 1979, with Mobile Suit Gundam, a TV series that defined
                the "real robot" mecha anime genre by featuring giant robots called mobile suits (including the original
                titular mecha) in a militaristic setting.

                The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes 50 TV series, films
                and OVAs as well as manga, novels and video games, along with a whole industry of plastic model kits
                known as Gunpla which makes up 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic-model market.

                Sunrise. The Gundam franchise had grossed over $5 billion in retail sales by 2000.By 2022, the annual
                revenue of the Gundam franchise reached ¥101.7 billion per year, ¥44.2 billion of which was retail sales
